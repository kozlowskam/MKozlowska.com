		Creative media editor, designer and audio-visual producer from Poland, currently based in The Netherlands. I design visual identity for individual clients, brands and events. I am experienced in the full process of creating video materials - all the way from the concept, through to the realisation, framing, filming, animating, editing and coordinating images with sound and music. With my background in music and sound recording I am able to create both the visual and audio layer of movies. 
I have wide knowledge of their technical realisation. I gained my experience while working on various projects and with different programs, which means I can make and edit videos in a wide range of styles and take on many roles, depending on your needs.

I am experienced in working with media as an editor and producer as well as coordinator - design and implementation of social media and communication and creative manager for cultural events and workshops. In this role I have gained many skills in the use of popular social media platforms and strong communication skills.

Recently I was working as a Project Assistant for RE:VIVE. This initiative by the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision brings together sound archives and electronic music. I was responsible for reuse of media archives to produce videos and collecting samplepacks of sounds and images. I was coordinating media, design graphics, working as an academic researcher, as well as curator and artist in residency.

As a Mill Burray I am producing music, visualisations ad videos. In my projects I often use 2D animations, which I am also producing, found footage and abstract compositions. In music I am connecting processed field recordings, foley sounds and various samples. All completed by intense bass line. The goal is to create new electronic beat compositions which, together with the visualizations, forming new, slightly ironic and playful environment. In Dj Sets Mill Burray includes various danceable tracks, both from well known as well as unknown producers. Whole interspersed with interesting and mirthful samples.
